This is the code used to produce the figures in "Striatal activity topographically reflects cortical activity", Peters et al., Nature (in press)
The data loaded by this code is available for download at: https://osf.io/x4q26/

The full codebase used in this paper (and possible dependencies) are in: 
https://github.com/petersaj/AP_scripts_cortexlab

There are possibly dependencies on:
https://github.com/cortex-lab

Included files: 
AP_ctx_str_figures_published - produces all figures
AP_load_concat_normalize_ctx_str - called by figure code (loads and normalizes data)
AP_ctx_str_trial_preprocessing - all preprocessing code used to produce data files from raw data
AP_ctx_str_grab_trial_data - called by preprocessing script (executes common preprocessing)

Any questions or issues I can address via Github issue
